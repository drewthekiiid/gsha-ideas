# “FireStarter”

---

### **PHASE 1: Lightning Lane (Arrival Experience)**

Guests step straight into the action the moment they arrive. Flash mobs, improv actors, and costumed “queries”—from giant question marks to living memes—swarm the entrance, tossing out wild, left-field marketing questions:

*“Pitch me the riskiest campaign you’ve ever dreamt up.”*

*“Sell me a Super Bowl ad for a product that doesn’t exist.”*

The energy is contagious. Those who try to play it safe get roasted by Gemini AI, their reactions instantly turned into playful memes projected overhead. The tone is set—ego gets checked, curiosity rules, and everyone is part of the show from the first step.

### **PHASE 2: Query Carnival (Immersive Main Space)**

Inside, the space erupts into a full-blown carnival.

Random pop-up stages burst to life as actors dramatize absurd, real-world marketing search queries.

No one is a bystander—guests are swept into the action, whether they’re sharing their strangest Google searches at confession booths (Gemini remixes these into campaign jingles and parodies) or competing in carnival games with a marketing twist: human claw machine, meme roulette, and more.

Victories and fails alike trigger Gemini-generated memes and “campaign advice” that light up every screen. The atmosphere is wild, unpredictable, and loaded with inside jokes only true marketers get.

### **PHASE 3: Ignition Extravaganza (The Main Event)**

Suddenly, the lights cut. An AI-driven “Query Tornado” fills the room—projected overhead, swirling with the night’s boldest, funniest, and weirdest queries, all voiced and animated by Gemini.

This isn’t a sit-and-watch awards show.

Winners are celebrated, sure—but they’re also hilariously “roasted” with over-the-top musical skits or meme dramatizations based on their oddest campaign moments.

Non-winners become the hype squad, handed confetti, horns, and masks, surging onto the floor for a full-on marketer mosh pit as Gemini unleashes a room-wide, custom meme drop.

Every attendee is woven into the spectacle—no wallflowers, just unfiltered industry energy.

### **AFTERMATH**

Every guest leaves with a scannable “Blackmail Folder”—packed with deepfakes, remixed campaign memes, and their own wildest moments from the night, plus a badge: “I Survived FireStarter Chaos. Ask Me Anything.”

The event goes viral before the afterparty even starts, and the FOMO is off the charts.

**Why it hits:**

This isn’t just an awards show—it’s a creative riot. Everyone gets pulled in, ego gets checked, Gemini sets the pace, and the whole thing feels like a marketer’s fever dream brought to life.

Nobody leaves untouched, and nobody will forget it.
