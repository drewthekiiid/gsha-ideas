# “Gemini Labyrinth”

---

### **High-Level Description:**

Upon entering, guests step into an immersive, AI-powered labyrinth—a living maze of projection-mapped corridors, portals, and chambers. Each turn and room responds to their Google Search data, campaign impact, and real-time decisions, visually “igniting” their path. The journey becomes a literal and metaphorical search for greatness, ending in a grand convergence where all paths, data, and energy unite for the main event.

### **How It Works:**

### **1. The Labyrinth Arrival**

- **Personalized Entry:** Guests scan their Gemini Pass to “unlock” a unique route through the labyrinth, each corridor aglow with their data: heatmaps, campaign keywords, live stats, even their own AI-generated “hype man” voiceover.
- **Interactive Chambers:**
    - Rooms highlight key themes—*Innovation, Performance, Impact*—with data-driven challenges, AR scavenger hunts, and collaborative puzzles powered by Gemini AI.
    - Every interaction feeds both personal and collective visualizations: as you succeed, your trail burns hotter and brighter behind you.
    - Hidden “Easter eggs” (from guests’ real campaigns, industry inside jokes, Google milestones) can be found and activated for extra fire bursts or spotlights.

### **2. The Convergence**

- **Live Data Mapping:** As guests navigate, the labyrinth’s central core (a circular data chamber) updates in real time—each path illuminating as guests complete their journey.
- **Culmination:**
    - The crowd finally gathers in the core, where all their “ignited” trails merge into a massive, collaborative heatmap—everyone’s data woven together in a fiery, Gemini-orchestrated spectacle.
    - Gemini addresses the crowd: “You’ve all made it through the labyrinth—your journey, your performance, your legacy.”

### **3. The Main Event**

- The core transforms into the awards stage. Winners are revealed as the brightest “flames” in the heatmap, but *every* attendee sees their journey—literally—projected around them.
- AR moments for guests: scan the core or their Gemini Pass to see their own journey replayed, with stats, campaign highlights, and a custom message from Gemini.
- Digital souvenirs: “I made it through the Gemini Labyrinth” badge, interactive recap of their search for greatness.
