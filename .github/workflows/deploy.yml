          # The basePath and assetPrefix are already set in next.config.mjs
          # So, no need to set them as env vars here for the build itself
          # unless your build process specifically requires them as env vars.
          # For GitHub Pages, the `next export` command handles paths correctly
          # based on `basePath` and `assetPrefix` in `next.config.mjs`.
          # However, if your custom domain setup requires specific env vars during build,
          # you might need to add them. For a standard GitHub Pages repo deployment,
          # the next.config.mjs settings are usually sufficient.
          # For custom domain, ensure your CNAME file is handled correctly or
          # configure the custom domain in GitHub Pages settings.
